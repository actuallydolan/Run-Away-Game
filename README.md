# Run Away
Just a small project for CSC506: Network Mobile Architecture. My group and I wanted to make a small Android game that utilizes
the accelerometer and data persistence.
# Getting Started
You would need Processing 3.5.3 or higher, although older versions should usually work.

1. Start your computer
2. Go to https://processing.org/download/ and download the most optimal version of the software 
3. Once downloaded, create a new project on Processing and download the zip file from the Github repository 
4. Drag all the files from the zip file into the new project folder, or into the Processing screen itself
5. Download the Sound and Cassette libraries in Processing and switch over to Android Mode if you haven't already
6. Connect to an Android device, run the project, and enjoy!


# Built With
* Processing

# Controls
As the player, youâ€™ll be controlling a circular character by tilting the device in the direction that you want the character to go.

# Quick Game Guide
Currently, the character selection features three different characters: Kirby, Steve, and Blue Ball. Feel free to choose any of them. 
As the player, you'll be trying to collect coins and powerups, while avoiding the enemies, which are depicted as ghosts.
Coins and powerups (which are depicted as mushrooms) give you a point each. As you collect more points, the ghosts will continue to spawn and 
become faster on average. Every four points will spawn a new powerup, which will either increase your speed (RED MUSHROOM) or permanently slow down the 
current ghosts on screen (GREEN MUSHROOM).
There's two modes: REGULAR and TIME CHALLENGE. Time Challenge simply closes the border slowly, making it so that you have a limited time to collect the most coins and powerups.
